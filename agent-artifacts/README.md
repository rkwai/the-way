# Agent Artifacts

Authoritative documents produced by the agents:
- `analysis/` — Market demand, business flow, and decision support.
- `product/` — PRD and data flow alignment.
- `ux/` — User flows and handoff notes.
- `architecture/` — C4 system map.
- `observability/` — Metrics, instrumentation, and evidence.

Keep these files current; they are the checkpoints that prove each workflow’s outcome.
