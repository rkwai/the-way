# Agents

This folder defines the three core agents and their task sequences:
- `data.yaml` — Data engineer (money & demand).
- `backend.yaml` — Backend engineer (money & data PRD).
- `frontend.yaml` — Frontend designer (user flows).

Each agent lists workflows composed of task files under `tasks/`. Run the agents through Codex so they orchestrate the tasks and keep artifacts in sync.
